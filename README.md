# Easy Digital Downloads Utilities Library

The EDD Polyfills Library aims to bridge the functionality gap in Easy Digital Downloads (EDD) 3.x by providing
essential polyfills for various features that are missing or incomplete in the core EDD plugin. Designed to seamlessly
integrate with EDD's existing architecture, this library introduces a collection of globally available functions that
adhere closely to EDD's naming conventions and variable declarations, ensuring a familiar and intuitive experience for
developers.

```

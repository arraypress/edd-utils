# Easy Digital Downloads Utilities Library

A comprehensive collection of helper functions and utility classes designed to streamline Easy Digital Downloads (EDD)
add-on development by consolidating common functionality for orders, customers, downloads, cart operations, and other
EDD components into a single, organized package. By providing a standardized set of utilities and abstractions,
developers can rapidly build EDD add-ons without recreating common functionality, significantly reducing development
time while ensuring consistency across their projects.

## Installation

Ensure you have the package installed in your project. If not, you can typically include it using Composer:

```bash
composer require arraypress/edd-utils
```
